The registered person's name and username should be displayed when the second image is clicked. [10 marks]
When the third image is clicked, it should display a picture of a dice. When clicking the dice, it should generate a random number between 1 and 6. The user should be able to click the dice 3 times. If the sum of the three generated values is greater than 10, the user should be able to click the fourth image.
